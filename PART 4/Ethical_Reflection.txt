Part 4: Ethical Reflection (5%)
Ethical Reflection: AI in Health Risk Prediction

In a recent project titled DiaWatch, we developed an AI-powered system to detect diabetes risk and recommend lifestyle changes. 
Recognizing the ethical implications, we committed to principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability.

To ensure ethical compliance, we selected open datasets with balanced demographics and audited them for bias. 
We implemented privacy protections by anonymizing all user data and securing model endpoints. Additionally, 
the system included explainable outputs to help users understand their risk scores, fostering trust and informed decision-making.
Moving forward, I will continue to use tools like AI Fairness 360 and follow the guidelines of responsible AI development, 
including stakeholder involvement, consent protocols, and regular evaluations for unintended harm.
