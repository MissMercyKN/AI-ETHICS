✅ Case 2: Facial Recognition in Policing
Scenario Summary
Facial recognition systems used by law enforcement have shown significantly higher error rates when identifying Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups, raising major ethical concerns. These inaccuracies can lead to wrongful arrests, privacy breaches, and systemic discrimination.

1. Ethical Risks
Wrongful Arrests: Misidentification of minorities increases false accusations and legal consequences.

Privacy Violations: Use of facial recognition without consent infringes on civil rights and surveillance ethics.

Amplification of Systemic Bias: If used without accountability, these tools can reinforce racial profiling.

Lack of Transparency: Many systems operate as “black boxes” with no insight into decision logic or errors.

2. Recommended Policies for Responsible Deployment
Mandatory Bias Audits

Require regular evaluations across demographics and publish performance reports.

Transparency & Accountability

Disclose datasets, vendors, and algorithms in use. Allow third-party reviews.

Human-in-the-Loop

Never rely solely on facial recognition for arrests; decisions must be confirmed by trained officers.

Legal & Ethical Safeguards

Enact laws that limit facial recognition to high-risk, regulated use cases. Require informed consent when possible.
